1.1 (10/16/2007)

   Namespace declarations in the root configuration file can now leave
   out the section declaration. In this case the task configuration must
   provide a section named [default_namespace], which will be selected.

   Fixed an error in the SkelCopier class which allowed recursion into
   directories that were supposed to be omitted.

   Fixed an error in the SkelCopier class which made it impossible to
   copy directory trees deeper than one level.

   Added a "destructive" option to the SkelCopier command. The SkelCopier
   would nornally skip any file where the destination already existed.
   The "destructive" flag will overwrite existing files.

   Removed documentation for "Fetch", it was incorrect.  The Fetch
   command is too magical to document and should likely be removed
   from commandlib.

   Fixed incorrect documentation: docs said there should be a [defaults]
   section in the root.ini file, it should have said there should be
   a [globals] section in the root.ini file.

   SkelCopier in commandlib did not work properly: it build incorrect
   target file paths.

1.0 (04/15/2007)

   Allow Fetch task to unpack zip files.

   New builtin global replacement value: 'platform', which is the value
   of distutils.util.get_platform() if distutils is installed.

   Fixed a bug in the guts of the postorder machinery to not generate
   too many duplicate tasks.
